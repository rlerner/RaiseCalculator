# RaiseCalculator
Figure out how much your raise will actually make you, exempting inflation, and figure out poop time to fix the gap.

Backstory: 3% raises are the bare minimum cost-of-living raises companies should give. Issuing less than that means your raise could really cost employees to continue working for you.

For example, getting a 2.91% raise when inflation is 2.07% (in 2016, for example) means the raise is actually only 0.84%.

With this tool, you can enter your current salary, desired salary, and then your current raise. This will "Do Math" and tell you how many hours you must spend pooping to adjust your labor output for your salary input.
